lab10x-Patrulescu-Ronald-Sandrino created by GitHub Classroom


* accept the individual assignment https://classroom.github.com/a/tPW0vtu4 (Links to an external site.) and work on the generated github repository, on the same problem from the previous lab; only a many-to-many and a one-to-many relationship are needed from the previous lab/problem, the entities that are not involved in these relationships may be dropped
* implement all crud operations, including operations on the relations, i.e., that involve aggregating data from several related entities
* use a client-server architecture with sockets
* simulate an RPC server (messages sent between the client and the server must be handled in a unitary manner (simulate RPC calls) ) 
* the server must be concurrent
* use Java 8 language features; threads with ExecutorService 
* only DB persistence is needed
* for the DB persistence, use JdbcTemplate (Spring)
* use Gradle for dependency management 
* XML configuration for Spring is not allowed; annotations and Java Config classes only 
* there should be three modules: client, server, common; the client and server modules depend on the common module; the module dependencies should be implemented in gradle
* a layered architecture should be used (ui, service, repository)
