* continue to work on the generated repository from the previous lab
* convert your previous project by replacing RPC with REST services using Spring RestTemplate
* use Spring DI and Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) --- xml config forbidden
*
* log messages using SLF4J
* project structure:
    1. A core module containing services, repositories, model classes
    2. A web module containing controllers exposed as RESTful Web Services
    3. A client module containing a console-based ui that accesses the RESTful Web Services using RestTemplate.
* implement all CRUD operations as well as statistics/reports that aggregate information from several related entities
*
* for maximum number of points: filter and sorting have to take place at the repository level without explicitly writing any specific code for such features (this is a self study task – see readme for documentation); so, for example, at the service level it should be possible to call a method like repository.findStudentsByName(“Ana”), which returns all students with the name “Ana”, without providing an implementation (Java code) for this method.
